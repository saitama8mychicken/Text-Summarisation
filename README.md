# Text-Summarisation
This is the process of shortening the length of a sentence in oreder to understand the sentence more faster
and get an idea about the sentence.

Everyone has experienced text summerisation where we just want a to get the idea of the article.

### There are two approaches to automating text summerization

1 - Extractive Method
 
    This involves extracting keyphrases from source and combining the to make summary . This is done without
    making making any changes to     the words. The drawback of this approach is that the sentence generated
    will be grammatically incorrect

2 - Abstractive Method 
    
    The abstraction technique entails paraphrasing and shortening parts of the source document. When abstraction 
    is applied for text summarization in deep learning problems, it can overcome the grammar inconsistencies of 
    the extractive method.
    
    The abstractive text summarization algorithms create new phrases and sentences that relay the most useful 
    information from the original text — just like humans do. Therefore, abstraction performs better than 
    extraction. However, the text summarization algorithms required to do abstraction are more difficult 
    to develop; that’s why the use of extraction is still popular.
